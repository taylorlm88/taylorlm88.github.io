## Professional Summary

I work part-time as a consultant writing software to help streamline the experimental process and data analysis in basic neuroscience research. This was an organic extension of my employment at the Janelia Research Campus, part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, from 2018-2021, where I handled all the software needs of my lab. I work as a private tutor and am in the early stages of pursuing my dream to help local schools get regular, in-school tutoring access for all students. I am a talented writer with current paid contracts for content creation, previous editing experience, and monetary awards in fiction. I am an Army veteran with degrees in physics and biology and experience in a variety of fields including research, academic and creative writing, software development, teaching, and more.
