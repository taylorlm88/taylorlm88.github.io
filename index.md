# Welcome to My Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet. I am Lisa Ferguson, a multi-talented professional looking to make the world a better place. I do that with three main skills I've developed through a diverse career - software development, education, and writing. I'd love to help you with a project or talk to anyone who shares my passion of providing accessible tutoring and supplemental education to all students who need it. Check out my services below for details regarding what I can do for you and your project!

## About Me

I have a diverse skill set spanning scientific research, software development, education, creative writing, and art. I approach projects with a holistic view and have the skills to contribute to projects as a whole, considering the entire range of needs from start to finish. I'm passionate about creating tools, pursuing and sharing knowledge freely, and telling stories.
