## About My Teaching

Schools are crowded and teachers are overworked, with only so much time to devote to any single student. Students can leave feeling behind or incapable, when in reality the subject is within their grasp if they just had someone to sit down and teach them, to really help them understand the underlying concepts.

Ideally, I prefer to tutor my clients regularly, so that I don't just help them pass a test, but can help them in the long run to understand the subject they're struggling with. Overcoming academic struggle teaches a person valuable lessons. I help students see this connection and gain confidence that will serve them for years after their formal education is over.

## My Vision for Educational Equity - Bringing tutors to every school

One of my core missions is advocating for universal access to tutoring services in all schools. Research shows that tutoring is most effective when done during school hours. Too many students struggle without the support they need, while quality tutoring remains out of reach due to cost or availability.

I envision a future where:

- Every school has dedicated tutoring resources available to all students
- Tutoring is seen as a standard educational support, not a luxury
- Students receive help before they fall behind, not after
- Educational support is equitable and accessible regardless of socioeconomic background

I'm actively working toward this goal through:

- **Advocacy:** I want to partner with schools or educational organizations to implement tutoring programs
- **Accessibility:** Seeking funding to subsidize tutoring for lower income families. 
- **Community Engagement:** Volunteering with educational organizations and mentorship programs
- **Resource Development:** Creating free educational materials and resources for students and parents

If you share this vision or want to discuss ways to expand tutoring access in your community, I'd love to connect.
