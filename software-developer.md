# Software Developer

## About My Development Work

Before I was a software developer, I was a scientist, and driving scientific research forward is my passion. As a consultant working mostly with researchers, I design software that eases the daily drudgery of coding and data handling for scientists who often never learned software development in their own education, only to enter the world of research and discover how vital it is.

I develop custom tools to help streamline inefficient or manual processes in any stage of research whether it be experiment design, execution, or post-processing of data. Standardization of protocols and data handling is vital in research to avoid small errors or biases that can have insidious impact on results, and is often best achieved by developing software tools. In the end, my goal aligns with the researchers who hire me - faster, better quality results that lead to faster, better quality developments in the field.

I primarily work in MATLAB and python, but am experienced in several other langages to includ HTML/CSS, C++, Javascript, SQL, Perl, R, and more.

## Portfolio

### Project 1: G4 Display Tools

**Technologies:** MATLAB, C++, Python

A large suite of user applications to standardize the design, execution, and analysis of neuroscience experiments. 

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/G4_Display_Tools)

---

### Project 2: Display Tools - Python

**Technologies:** Python, Pixi, Hatchling

A new set of tools allowing researchers to create display patterns and design experiments for neuroscience applications without the need for programming experience. Related to the G4 Display Tools, but for newer hardware, G4.1 and G6 systems, and open source (no longer reliant on MATLAB license)
